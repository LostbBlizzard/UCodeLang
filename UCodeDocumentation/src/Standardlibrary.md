# Standardlibrary

The Standard library is intended to be the minimum set of types and members required by a conforming UCode implementation. As such, it contains only those members that are explicitly required by the UCode language specification.

All of the Standardlibrary is Under The ULang Namespace.

```

    use ULang;

```

All of the Standardlibrary Part of StandardLibarary Module By UCodeLang

```

    import UCodeLang::StandardLibarary[0:0:0];

```

## Sections

- [Standardlibrary Types](Standardlibrary/Types.md)
- [Standardlibrary Functions](Standardlibrary/Functions.md)

## Notes

Under the hood the Standardlibrary uses [NStandardlibrary API module](./APIs/NStandardlibrary.md) to do  operating system calls.
