UCode is a programming language designed to be embedded into existing software such as game engines while being a low-level language with modern and high-level features.

mainly

- does not require a garbage collector like C#.
- offers more functionality than Lua.
- is easier to use than C++.
- Uses Compile time power to reduce boilerplate.

# Design Principles/Pillars

- Simple is better than complex.
- Zero-overhead abstractions
  - You don't pay for what you don't use.
  - What you do use is just as efficient as what you could reasonably write by hand.
-  Productive
   - Scalable compilation times
   - Reliable Tooling.
   - gradual learning curve
- Reuseable 
  - multi-paradigm
  - Compile time power

The was Language was designed  and developed by LostBlizzard On [GitHub](https://github.com/LostbBlizzard).

Who currently maintains the 

-[UCodeDocumentation](https://github.com/LostbBlizzard/UCodeDocumentation)

-The [UCodeLang](https://github.com/LostbBlizzard/UCodeLang) cplusplus implementation of the language.

-The Vs Code [Language Server](https://github.com/LostbBlizzard/ucode-lang)

The UCodeGameEngine(being worked on) the primary reason The Language was made.
