# float

floats types are used for floating-point values. Floating-point numbers are used for decimal values.


```
float A = 0.5;
float32 B = 0.5;
```

# float32

The float32 keyword maps to float.

float32 can be casted to int32 and float64 and vice versa.

## float64

float64 is the same as float but gives you 15 decimal digits precision but uses more space in memory.
